# The VBA of Wall Street
In this project, I use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

Test Data was used while developing my scripts.
Ran my scripts on Stock Data to generate the final project report.



## Stock Market Analyst

I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.
* Added functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

Note: Conditional formatting was used that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.
